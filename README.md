The Case Comp File was made to understand the main drivers of churn. We were also tasked with delivering solutions for customer retention. The data had 5636 observations and 36 total variables. Our response variable was "Left_flag" which was the binary indicator for churn. 

Our Results are:
1. Fiber Optic internet service is more expensive for the customer to operate. We believed this means Fiber Optic Service needs special consideration before it is implimented. It should be treated as a luxury product with higher standards of customer service and referral rewards since the product is more expensive. This would increase perceived value in the product.

2. We believe that there needs to be a greater focus on Home Offices and Business that require the benefits of Fiber Optics. These benefits include items like High Reliability, Lower Latency and symmetrical Upload/Download speeds. These are strong competitive advantages incomparision to its internal competitor of DSL (Copper Cable Based Internet).

3. We found that Add-On products greatly reduce customer churn. They make the value of leaving less enticing because the cost of leaving is also more expensive. They will need to replace more items in total.

We ran our code using Juptyer Lab which is based in Anaconda Navigator. The code is based in the Python coding language. The program was based on the "rententiondaata_case.csv" file. This will need to be downloaded in conjuction with the KGBoost based case file.
