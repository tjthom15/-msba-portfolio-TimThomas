What did you personally contribute to the most?
There are fantastic coders in my group and they really understood that part of the assisgnment well. I tried to gate keep some of the decisions because they started getting very technical in nature. Additionally, I helped make decisions and support the conversation analytically. I felt like I started moving in a managing position. 

• What is one decision or approach you personally advocated for and why?

Keep it simple. The slides keep moving towards 18 mins. It might have something to do with my Autism. It needed to stay in the rules of the assisgnment. The slides of the presentation moved to 18 and many of them could be removed. This approach moved to the decision of the model because of the AUC. Keep it simple, The decision came that the boosted model had the 
highest AUC score. 

• What are one or two lessons learned from the case competition, and what would
you add on or improve in your case if you had more time?

Too many cooks ruin the soup. We had 4 models to work and code with the data. We also had 5 people in our group. This meant that some of us could not help with the coding and led us to find other 
ways to help (Powerpoint, trying to build slides, etc). 

Additionally, The team waited until the last minute to put the slides together. This process was very frustrating. We could have made a much more polished product or pitch. I believe this is very evident with the note card reading. I wish it was much more polished.
